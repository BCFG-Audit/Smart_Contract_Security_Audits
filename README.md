# Smart_Contract_Security_Audits
From prototype to production, BCFG works closely with projects through the complete development cycle to identify security issues and recommend best practices. With recurring exploitations, rugpulls and hacks infiltrating the Decentralised Finance sector, our mission is to mitigate and pinpoint all possible security risks and flaws within each line of code.
